# 🎥 Movie_Listing_App
My aim was to simulate a simple web application which lists all the popular movies. 

## 🔗 Deployed Link
[Movie Listing Application](https://movie-listing-dsk.netlify.app/)

## 🛠 Technology Used
Javascript, HTML, CSS

## ⚙️ API Reference
This project uses The Movie Database V3(TMDB) API for fetching the movie details.

Documentation : [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## How I came up with this Design
I know that professionals use Figma, Adobe XD etc softwares for their product designs. But I was not familiar with those design tools so i tried simple wire framing tools available online.
