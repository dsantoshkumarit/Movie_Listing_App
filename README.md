# üé• Movie_Listing_App
My aim was to simulate a simple web application which lists all the popular movies. 

## üîó Deployed Link
Link : [Movie Listing Application](https://movie-listing-dsk.netlify.app/)

## üõ† Technology Used
Javascript, HTML, CSS

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Reference
This project uses The Movie Database V3(TMDB) API for fetching the movie details.

Documentation : [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## How I came up with this Design
I know that professionals use Figma, Adobe XD etc softwares for their product designs. But I was not familiar with the design tools so I tried creating a desing using a simple wire framing tool available online.
