# 🎥 Movie_Listing_App
My aim was to simulate a simple web application which lists all the popular movies. 

## 🔗 Deployed Link
Link : [Movie Listing Application](https://movie-listing-dsk.netlify.app/)

## 🛠 Technology Used
Javascript, HTML, CSS

## ⚙️ API Reference
This project uses The Movie Database V3(TMDB) API for fetching the movie details.

Documentation : [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

## 🎨 How I came up with this Design
I know that professionals use Figma, Adobe XD etc softwares for their product designs. But I was not familiar with the design tools so I tried creating a design using a simple wire framing tool available online and made it.

Online wireframe : [Movie Listing App Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/ULgkz7)

## 📊 How can I improve this project
If I had more time I could have added or done the below improvements :
    
    1. I could have added a section to 
    display upcoming movies. 

    2. I could have added more search 
    by fields like search by actor name, 
    director, rating etc.

    3. I could have made the application 
    more responsive and good looking by
    working more on the CSS part.

## 💻 How to run this application 
Just download this repository and open the index.html file in any browser.
